   One challenge you can face when implementing OCPP with this library is how you can build a full fledge CSMS.

   - How do i enable users to initiate CSMS calls?
   - How do i make it work with different webframeworks?
   - How do i use different websocket implementations?

   I thought this section could be a guide on using this library with different webframeworks.
